# What made us think about Info-Health? 🩺

Modern information platforms such as **YouTube** and **map-based services** deliver highly relevant results when users provide **precise and well-defined keywords**. However, in medical contexts, this requirement introduces a significant **usability gap** ⚠️. Most users do not have a medical background and are often unfamiliar with the correct **clinical terminology** needed to describe their symptoms accurately.

🗣️ While users may struggle to name probable diseases or formal symptom terms, they are generally capable of expressing their **physical discomfort, pain intensity, and affected body parts** in simple, natural English. This creates an opportunity for **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to function as an **intelligent intermediary** between human language and structured information retrieval systems.

🔍 In **InfoHealth**, the **Large Language Model (LLM)** bridges this gap by converting **human-expressed symptom descriptions** into **context-aware, platform-relevant keywords**. Instead of forcing users to search using **medical jargon**, the system allows them to describe their condition naturally. The LLM then assists in identifying the **most probable medical concepts** and refining them into keywords suitable for **educational video retrieval** and **location-based clinic searches**.

📊 From an evaluation perspective, the effectiveness of the **LLM** is assessed based on its ability to **improve the relevance and usefulness of retrieved results**. Compared to direct keyword-based searches, **LLM-refined queries** consistently produce more **focused and meaningful recommendations**, improving alignment between **user intent** and retrieved medical content.

🌍 By integrating **AI** with two of the most **trusted and widely used platforms**—**video-based information systems** and **map-based location services**—**InfoHealth** enhances both **accessibility and reliability** in healthcare information discovery. This approach prioritizes **speed, relevance, and clarity**, which are critical in **medical decision-support scenarios**. Importantly, the system does **not replace medical professionals** 🚑 but instead **empowers users** to seek accurate information and appropriate care more efficiently.
